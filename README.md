- 👋 Hi, I’m @Automatic-Airz, an undergraduate from China.
- 👀 I’m interested in **automation control**, **robotic arms**, and some interesting applications of these in chemistry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Chemistry**(my major) and **Automation Control**(my minor). By the way, I have fun playing Arduino devices in my spare time, since they are easy and cheap.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Sorry, currently I am too busy to work on other projects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Email: kak_air@mail.dlut.edu.cn
